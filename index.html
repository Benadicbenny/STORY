            <h1>MADARA</h1><br>
            <p>Madara Uchiha Japanese: うちは マダラ, Hepburn: Uchiha Madara is a manga and anime character in the Naruto series created by Masashi Kishimoto. He appears for the first time in "Part II" of the manga and the Shippuden anime adaptation, and serves as the supreme antagonist of the series. <br>He, along with its first Hokage Hashirama Senju, is one of the co-founders of Konohagakure (Japanese: 木ノ葉隠れの里, <br>Hepburn: Konohagakure no Sato) village from the ninja world. Their power conflict over how to run the village, as well as the long-time feud between clans, leads to Madara deciding that humanity is beyond saving, and seeks to cast a genjutsu on the entire planet that will eventually annihilate humanity and turn them into numerous variants of White Zetsu, with him the sole survivor. <br>This leads to his defection and apparent death in a battle with Hashirama; however, it is revealed later that Madara secretly survived well into elderhood, and manipulates main antagonist Obito Uchiha into laying the key for his future plans before his true death. During most of the series,<br> Madara serves simply as a posthumous background figure while Obito uses Madara's name to create aura around himself. <br>This changes when Kabuto Yakushi reanimates the real Madara, who eventually defies Obito and becomes the primary threat for the remainder of the series.<br>Kishimoto created the character to provide a strong villain in the series' final arc who would face the series' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki. This confrontation would be different from that with previous enemies and result in more of a focus on fight scenes. Merchandise has been released in Madara's likeness, including keychains, plush dolls, and figurines. In the Japanese anime, Naoya Uchida voices Madara, while Go Inoue voices him as a child. In the English version, Neil Kaplan provides Madara's voice with Xander Mobus voicing him as a child. Critics have commented on his role as an antagonist in the series; some have placed him on top all-time anime villains lists, while others have criticized his effectiveness. Nevertheless, Madara's background was well-received for how integral his story is to the series' scenario. Madara has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, and many Naruto video games, as well as the crossover games J-Stars Victory VS and Jump Force, have featured him as a playable character.</p>

            <h1>ITACHI</h1><br><br>
            <p>Itachi Uchiha (うちは イタチ, Uchiha Itachi) is a character in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto. Itachi is the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha, and is responsible for killing all the members of their clan, sparing only Sasuke. <br>He appears working as a terrorist from the organisation Akatsuki and serves as Sasuke's greatest enemy.
        
                During the second part of the manga, Itachi becomes involved in attacks to ninjas possessing tailed-beast creatures (Jinchuriki) until facing Sasuke in a one-on-one battle. Although Itachi perishes during the final duel, it is later revealed that Itachi had a secret reason for assassinating the Uchiha clan. Itachi is a playable character in most of the video games from the series. Itachi's character has been popular with readers of the manga[6] and has been positively received by critics. He is considered by many to be one of the best characters in the series. His appearance as an antagonist has been praised by several writers, although some have considered his initial appearance to be unsurprising. The gradual revelations of his past and its impact on the story has also received positive reception,<br> and his fights were noted to be "one of the best" in the series.[9][10][11] Numerous types of merchandise have been released in Itachi's likeness, including keychains, plush dolls and figurines.</p>

            <h1>OBITO</h1>
            <p>Obito Uchiha (Japanese: うちは オビト, Hepburn: Uchiha Obito), also known by his alias Tobi (トビ), is a character in Masashi Kishimoto's manga (and anime adaptation) Naruto. He is first introduced in a "Kakashi Chronicle" side story, as a young ninja who sacrifices himself to save his friends (Kakashi Hatake and Rin Nohara) from a cave-in. Although he was believed to have died in the 3rd Great Ninja War, Obito is later revealed as the real leader of the organization known as the Akatsuki, mainly acting behind the scenes for a majority of the group's tenure. He uses the alias of Tobi and later that of his benefactor, Madara Uchiha, and conceals his true identity with masks. As the leader of Akatsuki, Obito seeks to harness the power of the Tailed Beasts in order to cast a genjutsu that will put all of humanity into an idealized dream state forever, <BR>having lost faith in the real world following Rin's death. Obito serves as the main antagonist of the series, being the primary person at fault for the tragic backstory of series protagonist Naruto Uzumaki, whose personality and motivations are nearly identical to Obito's younger self, making them foils.</p>

        <h1>SASUKE</h1><BR>
              <p>Sasuke Uchiha Japanese: うちは サスケ, Hepburn: Uchiha Sasuke is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime franchise created by Masashi Kishimoto. Sasuke belongs to the Uchiha clan, a notorious ninja family, and one of the most powerful, allied with Konohagakure (木ノ葉隠れの里, English version: "Hidden Leaf Village"). Most of its members were massacred by Sasuke's older brother, Itachi Uchiha, before the series began, leaving Sasuke as one of the few survivors. Despite becoming empathetic toward his teammates Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, Sasuke's feelings of powerlessness force him to abandon his friends and his home in his quest to become stronger, and to find Orochimaru. Sasuke appears in several of the series' animated feature films and related media, including video games, original video animations (OVAs), and Boruto: Naruto the Movie (2015) and its manga sequel, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (2016), in which he is depicted as a vigilante supporting his village and a mentor to Naruto's son Boruto Uzumaki.
              Kishimoto conceived Sasuke as a rival of the series' title character Naruto Uzumaki. Despite Sasuke's dark character development later in the story, Kishimoto avoided portraying him as a villain; he found designing the character challenging and had difficulty creating a suitable look for him. Nonetheless, Kishimoto has grown to enjoy drawing him. In the manga's animated adaptations, Sasuke was voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in Japanese and Yuri Lowenthal in English.</p>
